## Instant Search

Build a minimal API that responds to a query term with a list of best possible matches. The source file `data.csv` contains > 300k names.

Use some data structure, which allows for API to work without iterating through the whole source data. API response time must be as low as possible (say ~10ms).

You can't use any external tool - database/cache

### Get started

Install flask:

```
pip3 install flask
```

Modify `server.py` to include your solution. Run it with the following command:

```
FLASK_APP=server.py flask run -p 8888 --reload
```

Open `index.html` to view the autocomplete input box and test your solution.

---

### Results & Ranking

The API must return results only when the query term length is >= 3 characters.
And it needs to rank search results according to below criteria (in order of priority)

1. Results that start with the query term must me given priority.
2. The shortest (in length) result is preferred.

#### For Bonus Points

- Associate a score/rank along with each result (and show it in the UI)
- Write test cases around the result ranking criteria.
- Allow fuzzy matches to show up (at the end of list)
  
  .e.g Searching for "comply" will pick up "Qui**c**k br**o**wn fox ju**mp**ed over the **l**az**y** dog"


The solution will be evaluated based on correctness, code quality, and use of (appropriate) data-structures.
